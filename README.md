This project uses NLP on NASA ASRS aviation incident reports to classify the root cause (pilot error, maintenance, weather, communication etc.).
Model is trained using Python + BERT (HuggingFace) to understand free-text reports.
Goal: automate incident analysis and improve aviation safety insights.
