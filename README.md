# Voice Command Based Aircraft Cockpit Assistant using Speech Recognition

This project converts pilot voice commands into cockpit actions using Speech Recognition (Whisper model).  
The system listens from mic, converts speech to text and responds with aircraft status like altitude, speed, fuel, landing gear etc.  
Domain is Aerospace and core tech used is Speech Recognition.  
This project aims to make cockpit control more hands-free and intelligent using AI.
